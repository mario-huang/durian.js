# durian.js

## what is durian.js
I believe that [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) is the most powerful and efficient API development framework on Node.js.

durian.js builds on the strengths of NestJS, running on [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun), and is designed with speed in mind — both in development and runtime performance.

## how fast is durian.js
- Development Speed: durian.js can be up to 16 times faster than NestJS in development.

- Runtime Performance: durian.js achieves up to 4 times the throughput, handling over 60,000 requests per second compared to NestJS’s 15,000.

- Latency: durian.js significantly reduces response times. The average response time is as low as 0.0008 seconds, while NestJS averages around 0.0033 seconds—making durian.js up to 4 times faster in terms of latency.
