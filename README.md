# durian.js

I believe that [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) is the most powerful and efficient API development framework on Node.js.

durian.js builds on the strengths of NestJS, running on [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun), and is designed with speed in mind â€” both in development and runtime performance.
